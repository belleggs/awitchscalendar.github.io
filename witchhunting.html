		<blockquote> 
		“Theories as to why the European witch-hunts took place are plentiful, but satisfactory explanations are in short supply. It is no longer convincing to blame men, or the patriarchal system, or the religious upheavals of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, not to suggest that witch-hunts were a consequence of warfare, famine and disease, or the social and political impact of state-building, or the rise of capitalism. While all of these developments, and many more besides, contributed to the overall story of the witch-hunts in Europe, no single event of episode was, or could be, fully responsible.” </blockquote>
